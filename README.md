# Is it Bash?
### is-it-bash
An easy way to test whether an executable file is a shell.

[WIP] Project is still a work in progress. Will finish as soon as I have some free time.

## Motivation

If an attacker were to gain access to a machine and replace /usr/sbin/nologin or /bin/false with /bin/bash, then they would be able to successfully login to many user accounts that they normally could not, effectively backdooring the machine. 

I saw this technique when I competed in the Mid-Atlanic Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (MACCDC).
